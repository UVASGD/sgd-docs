# Booking Space through the Newcomb Event Planning Services

### As an SGD Member
So you have to be labeled as an Event Coordinator for SGD on our @UVA page and we only get to have two of these, so you're going to have to talk to an officer.

### As an SGD Officer
Make sure you're an Event Coordinator on our @UVA page. Then, just go by the 4th Floor of Newcomb hall. Follow the signs and talk to Tessa (she's in charge and she knows us).

* Make sure you get confirmation by email within 2 days or else go back and bug them because thereâ€™s probably a problem. 
* Make sure you figure out and get a copy of the room setup
