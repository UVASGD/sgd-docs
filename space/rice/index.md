# Booking Space in Rice

* So you're going to go to the 5th Floor of Rice Hall and take a right out of the elevators. Then, the office is straight ahead. They're open during normal business hours (8AM - 5PM)
* Talk to a secretary there about reserving a room, and tell them it's for Student Game Developers
* They have some weird, stupid, and arbitrary rules about reservation times and lengths but you can convince them to ignore them if you're charisma is high enough.
