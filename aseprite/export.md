# Exporting Animations from Asesprite to Unity

First, you will need to [download Aseprite](./download.md). Next, you will of course need Unity so please see the [Unity subwiki](../unity/index.md) for that.

Next, you will need the [ASE to Unity Tool](https://github.com/UVASGD/tools-Aseprite-to-Unity). Download the latest release and import it into your Unity project through `Assets` -> `Import Package` -> `Custom Package...`. The repository has a readme that can guide you through the steps from there.
