<p>This article explains how to set up a <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> project hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> with <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> so that Travis can run unit tests as well as make builds and upload them to a dedicated server. An example repository with all the steps completed can be <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/unity-ci-test">found here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="an-aside-on-unity-cloud-build">An aside on Unity Cloud Build</h3>
<p>This tutorial assumes some proficiency with <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting">Bash scripting</a> and <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/for-beginners">Travis configuration</a>. This approach offers the ability to customize your build configuration (for example, if your project is a web app, you can conceivably deploy it automatically), but if you'd like a simple setup through a web interface it's worth checking out <a href="https://unity3d.com/services/cloud-build">Unity Cloud Build</a>. It offers the ability to run tests as well as make and share builds; <strong>it's recommended that you start out with Cloud Build before deciding if you need a more sophisticated setup.</strong></p>
<h2 id="setting-up-the-github-repository">Setting up the GitHub repository</h2>
<p>Following along with the <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/unity-ci-test">example repo</a>, setting up continuous integration requires a few files and folders in your project hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Scripts</code>: This folder contains Bash scripts used by Travis to execute the builds. Folder can be named whatever you want.</li>
<li><code>install.sh</code>: Deals with installing Unity onto the Travis image.</li>
<li><code>build.sh</code>: Deals with running unit tests and then creating builds if the tests pass.</li>
<li><code>post_build.sh</code>: Deals with uploading the builds onto a UNIX server.</li>
<li><code>upload.enc</code>: An encrypted keyfile for authenticating onto the aforementioned server.</li>
<li><code>UnityProject</code>: The actual Unity project folder (i.e. the one that'll have <code>Assets</code> and <code>Library</code> as subfolders). It's recommended to keep the Unity project as a subfolder in the repo so it's separated from the build stuff (as well as other non-Unity files you want to share). Folder can be named whatever you want.</li>
<li><code>.travis.yml</code>: Contains configuration for Travis.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you haven't created the Unity project yet, start with that. The example repo has a simple game for demo purposes. Note how <code>UnityProject/.gitignore</code> prevents plenty of local Unity stuff (e.g. <code>Temp</code>, <code>Library</code>) from being versioned.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-build-scripts">Writing the build scripts</h2>
<p>We will start with the install and build scripts. For <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/unity-ci-test/blob/master/Scripts/install.sh">install.sh</a>, our goal is to download the Unity installers onto the image and then execute them. Our Travis image will be OSX (since the Unity editor cannot be run on Linux), so to find the download links go to the <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">Unity download archive</a> and locate which version of the editor your project uses. For that version, locate the Mac <em>Unity Editor</em> URL, a .pkg file (note that it isn't the <em>Unity Installer</em> download, which is a .dmg file for GUI setup). If it isn't clear what that URL is, start and cancel a download on your machine, and then in your browser's downloads window, the link should be shown there. You can also inspect the HTML element since it's just a hyperlink.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="continuous-integration-0.png" alt="Finding the Unity download link" />
<p class="caption">Finding the Unity download link</p>
</div>
<p>An alternate way to locate the links is to use <a href="http://unity.grimdork.net/">this site which collects the links</a>, though it may not have the most up-to-date versions. There will be several different links per version, but you just need the top link for Unity Editor.</p>
<p>Starting in Unity 5, build support for different platforms is split across different installer modules. What this means is that the Unity Editor link you just found will only allow the Travis image to make builds for Mac OSX. If you want to make builds for Windows, Linux, WebGL, or other platforms, then you need to also download and install other .pkg files. Those URLs can be derived from the form of those on <a href="http://unity.grimdork.net/">this site</a>. Even if that site doesn't have the version you need, the .pkg files will be available at URLs with the appropriate hash value (the hex string part of the URL) and version number.</p>
<p>Below is a slightly truncated <code>install.sh</code> that downloads and installs version 5.5.1 as well as build support for Windows. Replace the URLs here with the ones you have found.</p>
<pre><code>echo &#39;Downloading Unity 5.5.1 pkg:&#39;
curl --retry 5 -o Unity.pkg http://netstorage.unity3d.com/unity/88d00a7498cd/MacEditorInstaller/Unity-5.5.1f1.pkg
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then { echo &quot;Download failed&quot;; exit $?; } fi

echo &#39;Downloading Unity 5.5.1 Windows Build Support pkg:&#39;
curl --retry 5 -o Unity_win.pkg http://netstorage.unity3d.com/unity/88d00a7498cd/MacEditorTargetInstaller/UnitySetup-Windows-Support-for-Editor-5.5.1f1.pkg
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then { echo &quot;Download failed&quot;; exit $?; } fi

echo &#39;Installing Unity.pkg&#39;
sudo installer -dumplog -package Unity.pkg -target /
echo &#39;Installing Unity_win.pkg&#39;
sudo installer -dumplog -package Unity_win.pkg -target /</code></pre>
<p>Next is <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/unity-ci-test/blob/master/Scripts/build.sh">build.sh</a>, whose duty is to run unit tests and then make builds. For unit testing, we will be using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html">Unity editor tests</a>, which are a relatively recent addition to Unity. How the actual tests are written is <a href="unit-testing.html">described here</a>. Once they are written, they can be executed in a headless mode with the following script.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Running editor unit tests for ${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME}&quot;
/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity \
    -batchmode \
    -nographics \
    -silent-crashes \
    -logFile $(pwd)/unity.log \
    -projectPath &quot;$(pwd)/${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME}&quot; \
    -runEditorTests \
    -editorTestsResultFile $(pwd)/test.xml \
    -quit

rc0=$?
echo &quot;Unit test logs&quot;
cat $(pwd)/test.xml
# exit if tests failed
if [ $rc0 -ne 0 ]; then { echo &quot;Failed unit tests&quot;; exit $rc0; } fi</code></pre>
<p>To make the builds, a similar command line call can be made. Different arguments are used for the different target platforms -- they are all <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html">listed here</a>. The below script shows how to execute a build for Windows.</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;Attempting build of ${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME} for Windows&quot;
/Applications/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/MacOS/Unity \
    -batchmode \
    -nographics \
    -silent-crashes \
    -logFile $(pwd)/unity.log \
    -projectPath &quot;$(pwd)/${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME}&quot; \
    -buildWindowsPlayer &quot;$(pwd)/Build/windows/${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME}.exe&quot; \
    -quit

rc1=$?
echo &quot;Build logs (Windows)&quot;
cat $(pwd)/unity.log</code></pre>
<h2 id="uploading-the-builds-to-a-server">Uploading the builds to a server</h2>
<p>You could stop at this point, knowing if the build succeeded or failed. However, if you need to distribute your built project (for example, suppose you have team members who need to run the project but do not have the Unity editor installed), then you need to upload it from Travis to some other location. If you have an AWS account, then <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/s3/">Travis can upload your build to an S3</a>. This example will assume we have a Linux server available to us.</p>
<p>First, if you have an admin account on a Linux server, it's probably best to create a non-admin account which will be used for receiving the builds. Then from that account, generate an SSH keypair with <code>ssh-keygen</code>. Transfer the private key to your local machine (e.g. using <code>scp</code>). From there, encrypt the file with <code>openssl</code> (this program was in Git Shell; you can do some searching to find it. Alternately you can try using the <code>travis encrypt-file</code> command with the Travis gem described below, but as of now it has issues on Windows). The line would look like</p>
<pre><code>openssl aes-256-cbc -k &quot;secret_password&quot; -in keyfile -out keyfile.enc</code></pre>
<p>Where the <code>&quot;secret_password&quot;</code> would be something you come up with, <code>keyfile</code> is the path to the cleartext private SSH key file, and <code>keyfile.enc</code> is the path to the encrypted version. Make sure that <code>keyfile</code> never gets versioned; only <code>keyfile.enc</code> should enter your repository.</p>
<p>Below is a version of <a href="https://github.com/SebastianJay/unity-ci-test/blob/master/Scripts/post_build.sh">post_build.sh</a>, which will <code>chmod</code> certain files so the build is runnable after you download it, <code>tar</code> and zip the files together, and then upload the tarball via <code>scp</code>. It is important not to leak any sensitive info like server name, account name, upload path, and authentication information in the Travis build logs (hence <code>&gt; dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code> at the end of the <code>scp</code> line).</p>
<pre><code>winname=&quot;${UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME}_win.tar.gz&quot;

# set file permissions so builds can run out of the box
for infile in `find $(pwd)/Build | grep -E &#39;\.exe$|\.dll$&#39;`; do
    chmod 755 $infile
done

# tar and zip the build folders
tar -C &quot;$(pwd)/Build&quot; -czvf $winname &quot;windows&quot;

# upload the tarballs to the server for storage
scp -i &quot;${UPLOAD_KEYPATH}&quot; \
    -o stricthostkeychecking=no \
    -o loglevel=quiet \
    $winname &quot;${UPLOAD_USER}@${UPLOAD_HOST}:${UPLOAD_PATH}&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1</code></pre>
<h2 id="writing-the-travis-configuration">Writing the Travis configuration</h2>
<p>We tie this all together with the <code>.travis.yml</code>, which will utilize everything else we've written. We will start with the snippet below; each mapping is commented with its function:</p>
<pre><code># do not install anything extra onto the image
language: generic

# use a Mac OSX image
os: osx

# only run builds on pushes to the master branch
branches:
  only:
  - master
  
# send email notifications when the build changes from succeeding to broken
notifications:
  email:
    on_success: never
    on_failure: change
    
# decrypt the encrypted SSH key file so it can be used for scp auth in post_build.sh
before_install:
- openssl aes-256-cbc -k &quot;$KEYFILE_PASS&quot; -in &quot;${UPLOAD_KEYPATH}.enc&quot; -out &quot;${UPLOAD_KEYPATH}&quot; -d

# run the script to download and install Unity editor
install:
- sudo -E sh ./Scripts/install.sh

# run the script for unit tests and builds
script:
- sudo -E sh ./Scripts/build.sh

# run the script to upload the builds as tarballs
after_success:
- sudo -E sh ./Scripts/post_build.sh</code></pre>
<p>All that remains is to add the environment variables used in the Bash scripts. All the variables used are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME</code>: the path to the Unity project (i.e. the folder containing <code>Assets</code> and <code>Library</code>), relative to the repo root.</li>
<li><code>UPLOAD_KEYPATH</code>: the path to the decrypted SSH key file, relative to the repo root. Note that this file does not exist in the repo, but the path is used in the <code>before_install</code> step to generate the file. The encrypted key file is assumed to have the same pathname with an extra <code>.enc</code> extension.</li>
<li><code>UPLOAD_USER</code>: the user name of the account used for <code>scp</code>.</li>
<li><code>UPLOAD_HOST</code>: the host name of the server used for <code>scp</code>.</li>
<li><code>UPLOAD_PATH</code>: the path on the server where the builds will be stored. Note that if this path leads to a public HTML directory, then that link can then be shared with a team to distribute the builds.</li>
<li><code>KEYFILE_PASS</code>: the password used to encrypt the SSH key file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of these variables, the first two can be stored as cleartext in the YAML, since they are not sensitive.</p>
<pre><code>env:
  global:
  - UNITYCI_PROJECT_NAME=&quot;UnityProject&quot;
  - UPLOAD_KEYPATH=&quot;./Scripts/upload&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The remaining variables, though, are sensitive and should not be visible to the public. We can encrypt either by using the Travis CI web interface, or by using the <code>travis</code> gem on the command line. To do the latter, install Ruby (<a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/">Ruby Installer</a> or <a href="https://rvm.io/">RVM</a>) and then run <code>gem install travis</code>. Then, use a line like the one below for each of the environment variables, and <code>.travis.yml</code> will get updated with environment variables starting with <code>- secure</code>.</p>
<pre><code>travis encrypt UPLOAD_USER=build_account --add</code></pre>
<p>With this done, the <code>.travis.yml</code> is complete. On the Travis CI web interface, flip the switch for your repo to turn builds on. Then, sit back and relax with the knowledge that automation has made your project uber awesome. ^_^</p>
