# Using GitHub with Unity

This article discusses how to effectively use [GitHub](https://github.com) with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) to prevent as many headaches as possible.

## Initial Setup

So, you're trying to use Unity with Git/GitHub? 

If you've never tried before, it's usually a pain. Unity uses plenty of [binary files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) by default, which cannot be merged together by Git without a conflict. Luckily, Unity has some convenient options that cause most of these binary files to instead be written as text files, which can be merged! Additionally, it's very important to acquire a functioning .gitignore file, in order to avoid committing the thousands of files that Unity autogenerates. Let's talk about these two things!

## .gitignore

The first thing you'll need to do is setup your repository, as normal. However, it's pretty important to first get a functioning .gitignore file. Luckily, GitHub actually has a built in Unity .gitignore, which is located in a dropdown menu on repository creation! However, if your project folder is nested inside the repository folder (such that your project hierarchy looks like /Repository/UnityProject/Assets/...), you'll need to make a few edits to the given .gitignore. Below, I've laid out what the base .gitignore looks like.

### Basic Unity .gitignore

/[Ll]ibrary/
/[Tt]emp/
/[Oo]bj/
/[Bb]uild/
/[Bb]uild
/Assets/AssetStoreTools*

# Visual Studio 2015 cache directory
/.vs/

# Autogenerated VS/MD/Consulo solution and project files
ExportedObj/
.consulo/
*.csproj
*.unityproj
*.sln
*.suo
*.tmp
*.user
*.userprefs
*.pidb
*.booproj
*.svd
*.pdb

# Unity3D generated meta files
*.pidb.meta

# Unity3D Generated File On Crash Reports
sysinfo.txt

# Builds
*.apk
*.unitypackage

### Edited Unity .gitignore
