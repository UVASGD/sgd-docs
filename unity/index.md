## Installing Unity

First things first: if you want to use Unity, you should probably go to their [website](https://unity3d.com/). In general, we suggest the free [personal version](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal). Both of these links will detect if your OS is Windows or Mac.

If for some reason you're looking for older versions of Unity, look [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).

Finally, if you're looking to get Unity running on a Linux machine, you're likely to have a hell of a time. The latest Linux is always a number of releases behind the latest Windows and Mac versions too. That said, here are some handy links:
