New officer positions may be added or removed by a unanimous vote of the executive board. Any changes made in this way will take effect when the next year's executive board stands for election.

The responsibilities of officers may be changed by a unanimous vote of the executive board.

### Article V: ELECTIONS.

Elections are to be held at the beginning of Crunch Night during the Spring semester. All officer positions shall be open for voting in the Spring, whereas only positions that are vacant at the end of the Fall semester may be voted for in the Fall during a special election under extenuating circumstances.

In elections, any member who has participated in a game project for at least one semester may stand for election to any officer position being voted on. The positions will be voted on in the order they appear in this constitution, as listed in Article IV. No person may hold more than one officer position at any one time - that is, someone elected to a position may not stand for another position. Newly elected officers will be transitioned into their roles by their respective predecessors and will take full responsibility for their positions in the club after the semester ends.

For each position, candidates shall give a short speech and answer questions, time allowing, from any members who wish to do so. After all candidates for a position have spoken, they will leave the room so that the remaining members may briefly discuss them. Afterward, present members will vote on which candidate to elect to said position. Voting will be conducted as follows:

All present members, except for the President and Vice President, shall vote anonymously on each candidate. Voting members may not vote for multiple candidates. After all candidates have been voted for, the President and Vice President shall total the votes, decide the winner by majority, and announce the winner to the club. In the event of a tie, voting will be conducted between the tied candidates. If another tie occurs, the President and Vice President will decide a winner amongst themselves.

Only voters present at the meeting during the time of voting may have their votes counted, unless a member submits a request to an executive board member to vote in absentia prior the beginning of Crunch Night.

Any officer may be impeached at any time by any other officer, in accordance with the following procedure: the PROSECUTING OFFICER, who is the officer who wishes to impeach, must provide justification to the entire executive board of the unsuitableness of the DEFENDANT OFFICER for carrying out their duties. The defendant officer must be present for this justification. Following the prosecution's justification, the defendant officer is given the opportunity to offer a rebuttal. A vote is then called. The defendant officer may request a recess of up to one hour before this vote is held. The vote requires an all but one unanimous vote from the executive board (not including the prosecuting and defendant officers) to impeach the defendant officer. If this succeeds, the defendant is removed from their position immediately and the highest ranking officer on the board may nominate another member to fill in until the next election. This nominee must be confirmed by a simple majority vote of the remaining officers. In the event that the impeachment vote fails, the prosecuting officer may not attempt to impeach any other officer until their term has ended.

### Article VI: MEETINGS.

General body meetings will occur on a weekly basis. Individual teams are encouraged to hold team specific meetings on a weekly basis.

### Article VII: FINANCE.

SGD will maintain a bank account. Only the Treasurer may access the funds contained therein, and they may only do so with the express consent of the president. The due amount will be assessed and set on a yearly basis by the executive board. The usage of said dues is entirely up to the discretion of the relevant year’s executive board. Members shall pay the said dues regardless of when they join the club within the academic year.

### Article VIII: BY-LAWS.

There are no by-laws.

### Article IX: AMENDMENTS.

Amendments to this constitution must be proposed and broadcast to the club by any officer at least seven days prior to the club-wide event where voting shall be held. A two-thirds majority vote by the voting club members is required to ratify any changes, unless otherwise stated in this Constitution. Any changes made are effective immediately, unless otherwise stated in this Constitution. 

### Article X: GAME RELEASE and INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

Following the completion of the game at the end of the semester, all components used in the final build of the game, such as assets and code, shall be in a publicly available repository under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC-BY-NC-SA) license.
