<p>So you have to be labeled as an Event Coordinator for SGD on our @UVA page and we only get to have two of these, so you're going to have to talk to an officer.</p>
<h3 id="as-an-sgd-officer">As an SGD Officer</h3>
<p>Make sure you're an Event Coordinator on our @UVA page. Then, just go by the 4th Floor of Newcomb hall. Follow the signs and talk to Tessa (she's in charge and she knows us).</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you get confirmation by email within 2 days or else go back and bug them because thereâ€™s probably a problem.</li>
<li>Make sure you figure out and get a copy of the room setup</li>
</ul>
