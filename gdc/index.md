# GDC Write-ups

The SGD officers traveled to [GDC](http://www.gdconf.com/) in early March of 2017. There was plenty of cool tech and games being shown off, and there were also many interesting sessions by speakers in industry. Many recordings of sessions can be found at [GDC Vault](http://www.gdcvault.com/); below are summaries of a couple sessions.
