<h1 id="portfolio-advice">Portfolio Advice</h1>
<p>The following is a bullet point summary of the talk <em>Killer Portfolio or Portfolio Killer: Part 1, Advice from Industry Artists</em> by Greg Foertsch (Firaxis Games), Lisette Titre-Montgomery (Ubisoft), Gavin Goulden (Insomniac), Wyeth Johnson (Epic Games), and Shawn Robertson (Ghost Story). A recording of the talk can be found <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024211/Killer-Portfolio-or-Portfolio-Killer">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prefer quality over quantity in a portfolio. Your portfolio is only as strong as its weakest piece.</li>
<li>Have a focus -- what kinds of games do you want to make? Trying to do everything on the portfolio can spread yourself thin.</li>
<li>Unless you are applying to a small studio (which may need generalists), hiring managers are looking for specific skills.</li>
<li>Presentation is important; the portfolio should be clean and easy to read.</li>
<li>Tell a story (i.e. by conveying an aesthetic or personality) with your pieces.</li>
<li>Knowledge of specific tools or programs is not very relevant so don't emphasize them. Being able to explain a methodology (e.g. how to reduce overhead or optimize some quality) is more important. That being said, knowing common tools and engines (e.g. <a href="https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-designer">Substance</a>) is helpful.</li>
<li>(Regarding sculpting) High detail sculpts are just the beginning; resumes with just that are useless. Go further with the low-poly models, UV, lighting, material, color theory, optimization. Pieces don't necessarily need to be shown in the game engine if there are other tools which serve your purposes (e.g. <a href="https://www.marmoset.co/toolbag/">Marmoset</a>). This idea applies to other fields as well (e.g. concept art on its own is not helpful if you don't show how things would render in-game).</li>
<li>Do not use class assignments or tutorials on portfolio. Be unique.</li>
<li>Video reels are not a great format (esp. music in videos). Choose a format that just shows the art and is respectful of the reviewers' time.</li>
<li>Fan art can be risky, as people in studio are very familiar with the subjects. You still need to add something new to the piece.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="more-general-advice">More general advice</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many of the &quot;origin stories&quot; of these artists involve luck and hard work. The latter can lead to the former.</li>
<li>When using social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), you are managing yourself as a brand. Hiring managers may be part of your audience, so curate your content and choose your voice carefully. A presence on <a href="http://polycount.com/">Polycount</a> or <a href="https://www.artstation.com/">ArtStation</a> is helpful.</li>
<li>Being a teacher is a useful skill; being active on forums can be a positive. Having some basic technical skill is also great.</li>
<li>Rejection is common; sometimes it just means the fit isn't there. Be persistent!</li>
<li>Don't wait to look for a job when you need it.</li>
<li>Show that you are someone who &quot;shows up&quot; (virtually, if working remotely), communicates, and takes direction.</li>
<li>Freelancers should consider themselves a &quot;service&quot; rather than just an artist. They should go above and beyond to please the client.</li>
<li>Art directors need to understand the &quot;why&quot; behind artistic decisions and be able to communicate with and manage people.</li>
<li>Specializations (possible new opportunities):
<ul>
<li>Virtual reality - new problems translating art to a 3D space</li>
<li>Level building - creating a level with story/atmosphere</li>
<li>Freelancing - small and midsize studios may be less interested in full-time artists</li>
<li>Stylized and performance-based animation - relative lack compared to motion-capture and procedural animation</li>
<li>Visual FX</li>
</ul></li>
