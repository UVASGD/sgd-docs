# Portfolio Advice

The following is a bullet point summary of the talk _Killer Portfolio or Portfolio Killer: Part 1, Advice from Industry Artists_ by Greg Foertsch (Firaxis Games), Lisette Titre-Montgomery (Ubisoft), Gavin Goulden (Insomniac), Wyeth Johnson (Epic Games), and Shawn Robertson (Ghost Story). A recording of the talk can be found [here](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024211/Killer-Portfolio-or-Portfolio-Killer).

### Content

* Prefer quality over quantity in a portfolio. Your portfolio is only as strong as its weakest piece.
* Have a focus -- what kinds of games do you want to make? Trying to do everything on the portfolio can spread yourself thin.
* Unless you are applying to a small studio (which may need generalists), hiring managers are looking for specific skills.
* Presentation is important; the portfolio should be clean and easy to read.
* Tell a story (i.e. by conveying an aesthetic or personality) with your pieces.
* Knowledge of specific tools or programs is not very relevant so don't emphasize them. Being able to explain a methodology (e.g. how to reduce overhead or optimize some quality) is more important. That being said, knowing common tools and engines (e.g. [Substance](https://www.allegorithmic.com/products/substance-designer)) is helpful.
* (Regarding sculpting) High detail sculpts are just the beginning; resumes with just that are useless. Go further with the low-poly models, UV, lighting, material, color theory, optimization. Pieces don't necessarily need to be shown in the game engine if there are other tools which serve your purposes (e.g. [Marmoset](https://www.marmoset.co/toolbag/)). This idea applies to other fields as well (e.g. concept art on its own is not helpful if you don't show how things would render in-game).
* Do not use class assignments or tutorials on portfolio. Be unique.
* Video reels are not a great format (esp. music in videos). Choose a format that just shows the art and is respectful of the reviewers' time.
* Fan art can be risky, as people in studio are very familiar with the subjects. You still need to add something new to the piece.

### More general advice

* Many of the "origin stories" of these artists involve luck and hard work. The latter can lead to the former.
* When using social media (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram), you are managing yourself as a brand. Hiring managers may be part of your audience, so curate your content and choose your voice carefully. A presence on [Polycount](http://polycount.com/) or [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/) is helpful.
* Being a teacher is a useful skill; being active on forums can be a positive. Having some basic technical skill is also great.
* Rejection is common; sometimes it just means the fit isn't there. Be persistent!
* Don't wait to look for a job when you need it.
* Show that you are someone who "shows up" (virtually, if working remotely), communicates, and takes direction.
* Freelancers should consider themselves a "service" rather than just an artist. They should go above and beyond to please the client.
* Art directors need to understand the "why" behind artistic decisions and be able to communicate with and manage people.
* Specializations (possible new opportunities):
    * Virtual reality - new problems translating art to a 3D space
	* Level building - creating a level with story/atmosphere
	* Freelancing - small and midsize studios may be less interested in full-time artists
	* Stylized and performance-based animation - relative lack compared to motion-capture and procedural animation
	* Visual FX
