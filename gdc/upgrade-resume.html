<p>The following is a bullet-point summary of the talk <em>Get Noticed &amp; Get Hired: Upgrading the Game Industry Resume</em> by Sonia Michaels (DigiPen), Mojan Ahmadi (DigiPen), Alexandra M. Lucas (Microsoft), Rachel Thompson (DigiPen), and David Lau (Amazon). The slides for this talk can be found <a href="http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024411/Get-Noticed-Get-Hired-Upgrading">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prioritize your professional experiences, projects, and skills over your education and credentials. The former communicates your value more effectively.</li>
<li>When adding new information, include title (job description), place (company name), and dates of your employment</li>
<li>Aim for 3 to 5 bullet points per experience. Have a purpose in mind for each bullet point, i.e. &quot;What should the employer notice about me through this point?&quot; Think about these points with the following steps:
<ul>
<li>What did you do? Clear actions, typically verbs can start off the bullet point</li>
<li>How did you do it? Skills or strategies used</li>
<li>How many? Use data to validate your point</li>
<li>Why does it matter? Establish the significance of the point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use specifics (strong qualifiers and quantitative descriptions) and don't embellish. Apply the &quot;So What?&quot; test to your bullet points -- i.e. why should the hiring manager care?</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to list points that make you stand out (e.g. one speaker put Xbox Gamerscore on resume).</li>
<li>Present your skills categorically. A laundry list of unorganized skills is difficult to read.</li>
<li>Avoid rating your skills on a numerical scale, as such measures are subjective.</li>
<li>Communicate your passions and interest in issues connecting games and the world with positively phrased, objective descriptions. It's a personal choice of how much of your beliefs and ideals to expose on the resume. If you're submitting just to get past HR cullings, then not much may be needed.</li>
<li>Communicate that you are a professional and not a student. Avoid &quot;academic&quot; terminology such as &quot;course&quot;, &quot;semester&quot;, etc.</li>
<li>Improvement of your resume is a continuous process of finding and fixing gaps. Avoid showing the same resume to the same employer twice.</li>
<li>Alumni are a good resource for reviewing resumes or getting acquainted with industry.</li>
<li>Understand the hiring manager's business requirements, the studio's organizational structure, and your fit, talent, and growth potential. Frame your resume around eliciting a good reaction from the manager.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aesthetic">Aesthetic</h3>
<ul>
<li>Color is OK in a resume, particularly for artists and designers. Make sure the aesthetic is consistent, though.</li>
<li>Readability is a priority; creativity in formatting of the resume is OK so long as readers can still interpret it easily.</li>
<li>View white-space on the resume as real estate -- adjust your margins, wrapping, and spacing to maximize its use.</li>
<li>Make intentional aesthetic choices (e.g. colors, fonts, spacing). Be consistent with formatting, naming conventions, placement of information.</li>
<li>Personal branding: the goal is to clearly identify all material as yours
<ul>
<li>Color is packed with symbolism. Be aware of biases.(<a href="https://www.colormatters.com/">Color Matters</a> may be a useful resource)</li>
<li>Fonts can draw attention to your targeted profession. (<a href="http://www.dafont.com/">DaFont</a> and <a href="http://www.fontspace.com/popular/fonts">FontSpace</a> are some resources)</li>
<li>Icons may contain your favorite animals, objects, or symbols associated with your craft. If you're not an artist, consider commissioning one to create your own icon.</li>
