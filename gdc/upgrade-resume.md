The following is a bullet-point summary of the talk _Get Noticed & Get Hired: Upgrading the Game Industry Resume_ by Sonia Michaels (DigiPen), Mojan Ahmadi (DigiPen), Alexandra M.

### Content

* Prioritize your professional experiences, projects, and skills over your education and credentials. The former communicates your value more effectively.
* When adding new information, include title (job description), place (company name), and dates of your employment
* Aim for 3 to 5 bullet points per experience. Have a purpose in mind for each bullet point, i.e. "What should the employer notice about me through this point?" Think about these points with the following steps:
    * What did you do? Clear actions, typically verbs can start off the bullet point
	* How did you do it? Skills or strategies used
	* How many? Use data to validate your point
	* Why does it matter? Establish the significance of the point
* Use specifics (strong qualifiers and quantitative descriptions) and don't embellish. Apply the "So What?" test to your bullet points -- i.e. why should the hiring manager care?
* Don't be afraid to list points that make you stand out (e.g. one speaker put Xbox Gamerscore on resume).
* Present your skills categorically. A laundry list of unorganized skills is difficult to read.
* Avoid rating your skills on a numerical scale, as such measures are subjective.
* Communicate your passions and interest in issues connecting games and the world with positively phrased, objective descriptions. It's a personal choice of how much of your beliefs and ideals to expose on the resume. If you're submitting just to get past HR cullings, then not much may be needed.
* Communicate that you are a professional and not a student. Avoid "academic" terminology such as "course", "semester", etc.
* Improvement of your resume is a continuous process of finding and fixing gaps. Avoid showing the same resume to the same employer twice.
* Alumni are a good resource for reviewing resumes or getting acquainted with industry.
* Understand the hiring manager's business requirements, the studio's organizational structure, and your fit, talent, and growth potential. Frame your resume around eliciting a good reaction from the manager.

### Aesthetic

* Color is OK in a resume, particularly for artists and designers. Make sure the aesthetic is consistent, though.
* Readability is a priority; creativity in formatting of the resume is OK so long as readers can still interpret it easily.
* View white-space on the resume as real estate -- adjust your margins, wrapping, and spacing to maximize its use.
* Make intentional aesthetic choices (e.g. colors, fonts, spacing). Be consistent with formatting, naming conventions, placement of information.
* Personal branding: the goal is to clearly identify all material as yours
    * Color is packed with symbolism. Be aware of biases.([Color Matters](https://www.colormatters.com/) may be a useful resource)
    * Fonts can draw attention to your targeted profession. ([DaFont](http://www.dafont.com/) and [FontSpace](http://www.fontspace.com/popular/fonts) are some resources)
    * Icons may contain your favorite animals, objects, or symbols associated with your craft. If you're not an artist, consider commissioning one to create your own icon.
